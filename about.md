Me and my people have been hard at work on this website/blog. Its been a lot trial and error, and heartache. but we've done ok. we look forward to the journey ahead!

So far we've used  [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a few other websites we'll link to later. They been much help and a lot of fun to use.
other themes possibly coming up later from:
